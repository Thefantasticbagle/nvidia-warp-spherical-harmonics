# NVIDIA Warp Overview

## What is NVIDIA Warp?

NVIDIA Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance GPU-accelerated code without needing to know CUDA or other low-level programming languages. It enables developers to write Python code that can run efficiently on both CPU and GPU, with automatic compilation and optimization.

## Key Features Used in this Project

This project leverages several key features of NVIDIA Warp:

### 1. Compute Kernels

Warp kernels are functions that can be executed in parallel across many threads. In this project, we define two main kernels:

- `draw`: Renders the visualization by ray-casting against a sphere and evaluating spherical harmonic functions
- `bake`: Computes spherical harmonic coefficients from an environment map using Monte Carlo integration

Example kernel definition:

```python
@wp.kernel
def draw(cam_pos: wp.vec3, width: int, height: int, 
         pixels: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3), color_min: float, color_max: float,
         l_param: int, m_param: int,
         skybox: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3, ndim=2),
         seed: int,
         sh_coeffs: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3)):
    # Kernel implementation
    # ...
```

### 2. Custom Data Types

Warp provides built-in vector types (`wp.vec3`) and allows for custom struct definitions, which we use for ray-tracing:

```python
@wp.struct
class Ray:
    origin: wp.vec3
    direction: wp.vec3

@wp.struct
class Sphere:
    pos: wp.vec3
    radius: float
```

### 3. GPU Arrays

Warp arrays provide efficient GPU memory management:

```python
# Create arrays on the GPU
self.pixels = wp.zeros(self.width * self.height, dtype=wp.vec3)
self.sh_coeffs = wp.zeros(num_coeffs, dtype=wp.vec3)
```

### 4. Device Management

The project uses Warp's device management to run on specific hardware:

```python
with wp.ScopedDevice(args.device):
    # Code runs on the specified device
```

### 5. Performance Timing

Warp provides built-in performance measurement:

```python
with wp.ScopedTimer("render"):
    # Code being timed
```

## Advantages Over Raw Python

Compared to standard Python with NumPy, using NVIDIA Warp for this project provides several advantages:

1. **Performance**: Orders of magnitude faster execution, especially for the mathematically intensive spherical harmonic calculations

2. **Parallelism**: Automatic parallelization across thousands of GPU cores without explicit thread management

3. **Memory Efficiency**: GPU memory management with minimal copying between CPU and GPU

4. **Code Clarity**: Clean, Python-like syntax while achieving near-CUDA performance

5. **Developer Productivity**: Fast iteration cycle with automatic just-in-time compilation

## Implementation Particulars

### Optimizing for Warp

This project employs several Warp-specific optimizations:

1. **Function Decorators**: Using `@wp.func` for device functions that are inlined into kernels

2. **Atomic Operations**: Using `wp.atomic_add` for thread-safe accumulation during the baking process

3. **Kernel Launch Configuration**: Directly specifying the thread dimension with the kernel launch:

   ```python
   wp.launch(kernel=bake, dim=BAKE_SAMPLE_COUNT, inputs=[...])
   ```

4. **Synchronization**: Using `wp.synchronize()` to ensure all GPU work is completed before accessing results

### Data Flow

The typical data flow in the application:

1. **Image Loading**: CPU loads image data which is transferred to GPU arrays
2. **Baking**: GPU computes spherical harmonic coefficients
3. **Rendering**: GPU renders pixels based on camera position and SH coefficients
4. **Visualization**: GPU array is transferred back to CPU and displayed with Matplotlib
